## ESP32-S3-Embassy-Template

This repo acts as a template for designing Embassy runtime applications on the ESP32-S3 family of chips. 
The initial repo contains a multi-core LED blinky "Hello World!" project.

## Flashing Note
Some boards require the chip to be put into bootloader mode before flashing, while others do not.
